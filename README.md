# Probe Grap(p)le Mod v.1.1.1
Mod for the Alpha Outer Wilds version 1.2 that adds a grapple rope to the game

### What it does?

It gives the player a new equipment to use: a *grappling rope*, it acts like a long rubber band and can have its size increased and decreased

### How do I use it?

Here is what each button does:

  **G** - Throws the rope anchor | Retrieves the anchor
  
  **T** - Makes the rope longer: at each quarter of a second that the button is held, it has an increase of  25 cm (untill it reaches 100m)
  
  **Y** - Same as the **T** button, but it decreases the rope size (untill it reaches 75 cm)
  
  * The rope starts with a length of 5m, and you can change its size before throwing it
  * The rope *breaks* when you are 25m + its length away from it
